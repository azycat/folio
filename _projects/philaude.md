Philosophy is a genre that is notoriously difficult casual readers to breach. Yet, contained within these dusty old tombs are important concepts and theories that shaped our culture.

How can we bring these ideas into the modern age, while preserving the author’s original words?

## Introducing Philaude

**Philaude** (short for “philosophiclaude”) is an AI-powered reading assistant that aims to lower the barrier of entry to philosophical literature. This project uses Claude AI’s language processing and large context capacity to make these works accessible for modern readers.

With a digital bookshelf full of public domain works, users can save their progress in the database and continue from where they left off.

Targeting laypeople and casual genre enthusiasts, this approach offers real-time support for understanding complex concepts and historical references without losing the original author's voice.

Future features envision expanded reader functionality, cross-book concept connections, and AI customizability to suit diverse user experience levels.
