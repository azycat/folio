Utilizing locally-run large language models (LLMs) for privacy-important tasks.

## AI Psychiatric Assistant

Keeping an accurate record of a patient’s history allows for a holistic approach towards diagnosis and care. In psychiatric practice, the foundation of a patient’s background is established during the initial consultation. However, 20-50% [1] of this time is spent on basic data-gathering of common personal information–a process which can delay treatment and assessment of present issues. 

With a privacy-oriented design in mind, we propose the usage of external AI tools to help clinicians gather and maintain background information. Computerized automated history-taking systems have been developed previously for general practitioners, but there are very few psychiatry-specific uses.

Furthermore, we aim to show how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to optimize the relevancy/usefulness of the data collection process.
