nostalgic clicker game developed in unity
- download shady programs off the internet to solve captchas automatically
- captchas grow increasingly more absurd as your automation becomes more efficient. an analogy for the technological race that's ensued since the advent of modern AI. it becomes harder to prove you're "not a bot".

i got to lead the design, yay! really proud of this one.

it was an interesting thought experiment designing the captcha questions. didn't want to make it too difficult the real human player. hard to associate objective qualities between images. (e.g. "select all that you can take in a fight" -- what if you could really take down a dinosaur?)

since this project was made, image recognition has obviously gotten better. captchas have indeed gotten harder. it's cool to see some of our ideas show up in the wild

It was my first time being so involved in the community for a game jam. While promoting our game, I got to interact with many other talented developers. I'm grateful for all the wonderful comments we received.
