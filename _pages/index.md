I'm `azy`, a programmer fascinated by digital and neural systems. My love lies in the intersection between computers, brains, and cognition.

Besides that, I've written some software (mostly Python, Java, some C) and created [some games](https://cureja.itch.io/). Currently, I'm developing AI tools to assist in clinical psychiatry at the UBC Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.

In my spare time, I like messing with retro computers, researching pointless topics, and making my life harder trying to make my life easier with technology. It's a noble pursuit.

Thanks for stopping by. The site is still a work in progress; don't mind the rough patches.
