I'm `azy`, a programmer fascinated by digital and neural systems. My love lies in the intersection between computers, brains, and cognition.

Besides reading, swimming, and researching pointless topics, I've written some software (mostly Python, Java, some C). Currently, I'm developing an AI psychiatric assistant at the UBC Brain Circuits Cluster.

In my spare time, I like messing with retro computers and making my life harder trying to make my life easier with technology. It's a noble pursuit.

Thanks for stopping by. The site is still a work in progress; don't mind the rough patches.
