I'm `azy`. I love digital systems -- computers, software, brains...

The major evolutionary advantage of a digital medium for storing information is that it can persist across thousands of generations. With that said, I'd also like to create some meaningful change that lasts beyond my lifetime.

I have an old soul. In my spare time, I like to collect and repair vintage computers.
